# ML FrontEnd Test

React/Express App.

_Not implemented due to lack of time: Unit tests (Jest), Loader Widget (for API calls)._

Client is inside client folder.

## Use

### Development

  1. Run server
  
  ```
  npm i
  npm start
  ```
  
  2. Run client (in another terminal)
 
  ```
  cd client
  npm i
  npm start
  ```
  
  The app will run on `http://localhost:3000`
  
  
  ### Production
  
  1. Build client _(note: a build folder is already uploaded to the repository, thus this step can be omitted)_
  
  ```
  cd client
  npm i
  npm run build
  ```
  
  2. Run the server, in the root folder:
  
  ```
  npm i
  npm start
  ```
  
  The app will run on `http://localhost:5000`
  
  ### Test
  
  ```
  cd client
  npm i
  npm test
  ```
